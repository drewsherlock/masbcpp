To build the Docker image:

docker-compose -p project_name build

To run:

docker-compose -p project_name build

To open Notebooks go to:

http://localhost:9988/?token=<token>

where <token> can be seen in the console when the Docker container is started (note: docker-compose is configured to map internal port 8888 to 9988 externally)

for example:

http://localhost:9988/?token=f034d41a84d86db8560bf340bef099a096bb86a33bea20b9

the /home/analytics/notebooks directory in the Docker container is mapped onto your local notebooks folder so notebooks can be saved and kept between runs.

masbcpp is built in /tmp/stuff/masbcpp in the Docker image copied from this directory. You should be able edit code locally and then build the Docker image again (see above) to recompile.
